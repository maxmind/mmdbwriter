# Go MaxMind DB Writer

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/maxmind/mmdbwriter.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/maxmind/mmdbwriter)

This is a Go writer for the [MaxMind DB format](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB).

This is still a work in progress and does not support all of the features
of the [Perl writer](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-perl). The
API is subject to change.

## Examples
